## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Clean Code Design was created to encompass code components and plugins that exemplify Clean Code principles and eliminate any and all clutter. The goal is to leverage even the most complex features of all evolving technologies to make the developer experience as simple as possible. 

The components created in this organization are designed with plug-and-play in mind. Each one will encapsulate a different pattern found in most professional software. An example of this is that most projects have a configuration file. Something that many developers will do is to pull that configuration into a set of type-safe objects stored in an Inversion of Control container at runtime. The setup for converting a configuration file into objects is generally the same, no matter the project.
